						VIDEO TAGGING

1.Feasibility:
	Video tagging enables machines to assign relevant keywords to digital pictures. 
	This process is used in image retrieval systems for organizing images in a vast database. 
	It is a part of multi-class machine learning image classification.
2.Methodology:
	In this tagging method the model analyses  and understands objects, people, text and
	scenes within imagery and video.Then uses these information to generate relevant tags for the video.
3.Challanges:
	The challanges we face in implementing this model is when we have blur,high contrast,noise in the video
	it is difficult for the model to predict correcty.Same thing happens when there are too many objects in 
	the background.
